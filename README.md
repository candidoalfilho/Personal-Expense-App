# Personal Expenses App

A new Flutter&Dart App, with new things I have recently learned about styling, theming and Flutter&Dart. I am grateful for what I have learned on the production of this simple app, I am looking forward to always improve.


## Content

Personal Expenses App is an App constructed with Flutter&Dart, that runs both on IOS and Android. This app registers your expenses over the days and allow you to describe the title, amount and date of each transaction you made with a beautiful UI. Feel free to clone this repository and test this code on a virtual machine. The following items helped me on this production:

- Java Knowledge - If it weren't for Java, I'd pretty much be confused about programming.
- Flutter&Dart - These two miracles from the programming world made me 100% more interest on programming. They surely do miracles.
- VSCode - I have tried several other IDEs, and surely this is the best one.
- Android Virtual Machine - It is astonishing how AVM makes you experience the production of a real app.
- Udemy - Seriously, this is the future of knowledge.
- GitHub - GitHub is a must for all programmers nowadays, my cheers to this website.
- Dillinger - It surely helped me construct this fabulous README file.
