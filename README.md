# Personal Expenses App

A new Flutter&Dart App, with new things I have recently learned about 
about Widgets and styling.


## Content

FlutterQuiz is a basic quiz app that asks you three questions and return you a final answer based on the options you chose, you have the option to reset the quiz if you want in the end. The following items helped me on this production:

- Java Knowledge - If it weren't for Java, I'd pretty much be confused about programming.
- Flutter&Dart - These two miracles from the programming world made me 100% more interest on programming. They surely do miracles.
- VSCode - I have tried several other IDEs, and surely this is the best one.
- Android Virtual Machine - It is astonishing how AVM makes you experience the production of a real app.
- Udemy - Seriously, this is the future of knowledge.
- GitHub - GitHub is a must for all programmers nowadays, my cheers to this website.
- Dillinger - It surely helped me construction this fabulous README file.
